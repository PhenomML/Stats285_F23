# Homework 5. Driving Parameters while Growing into a Cluster.

Heretofore, we have been running on a single node. Today's computing activity will introduce our use of parameter ramps and the beginnings of using a cluster -- first on a larger node and then on an array of nodes.

## Computing activity

We have been very careful to keep our code simple. Why? Debugging a server is quite a bit more difficult than debugging code on your laptop, a parallel server, unsurprisingly, more so. Hence, we want you to perfect your code on your laptop and then scale it up without change. To this end, we introduced simple code that created the results of a 1000 x 1000 SVD of noisy data. We then repackaged it as a function that takes keyword arguments and returns a DataFrame. This code we ran on both your laptop and a server. That brings us to our fourth computer activity -- computing with a cluster to create the core data for a 1,000,000 x 1,000 SVD and saving your data to the cloud. Once the data is in the cloud, it is easy to read it into a Jupyter or Colab notebook to finish the tall and skinny SVD calculation.

We are starting by following the advice of the Stanford Research Computing Center, SRCC, staff to use the `sbatch array` command to launch a group of tasks while allowing `sbatch` to assign some of your parameters. In this example, we take the same experimental function, `map_function.py` in the project, and drive it from the command line. We also introduce saving the data to the remote database, Google BigQuery. What you will find is that the `sbatch array` command is really oriented around the command line and creating text files. It isn't a good fit for database centric computing. Hence, we play to the strengths of the traditional supercomputing infrastructure to write the data as files, gather them together and then write them to the remote database. As we've maintained in this course, almost anytime you create a file, it is an opportunity for human intervention and higher friction. Hence, there are three functions involved: `map_function.py`, `gather_csv_to_gbq.py`, and `HW5_analysis.ipynb`. `map_function.py` creates a bunch of `.csv` files; which are read into `gather_csv_to_gbq.py` and are sent to Google BigQuery. This experiment is driven by the `sbatch` script `hw5_array.sh`. 

To replace your burden on gathering computational results, we are going to start using a simple system to run many independent tasks and write the results to the remote database. This system, [EMS or Experiment Management System](https://github.com/adonoho/EMS), takes a definition of your parameters as arrays and then calls your function with the combination of all parameter values. It then stores the result of each function in a database. (This is the beginning of a research tool for the Stanford Donoho Lab. Yet, even at this early date, it is useful.)

Because modern laptops contain many processors, the one I am writing this on has 6 symmetric cores and can run 12 concurrent tasks, you can frequently run your code quite a bit faster than normal using EMS. EMS depends upon a Python system called Dask which can allow quite complex parallel operations. As our tasks are embarrassingly parallel, we will not be exploiting Dask for other than processor/thread/worker management. But it is available for more advanced work. For example, there is an advanced way to use Dask to solve the [Tall & Skinny SVD problem](https://examples.dask.org/machine-learning/svd.html#Compute-SVD-of-Tall-and-Skinny-Matrix).

EMS always saves your data locally via SQLite in your `data/` directory. On Mac or Windows, you can examine this file using [SQLite Studio](https://sqlitestudio.pl). Hence, you can always use EMS without a cloud database. This is quite useful for debugging your code. You can easily compare your data between runs by just changing your table name. Then, when you are ready to start more formal experimentation, we can start telling EMS to additionally use a cloud database, Google Big Query in this class. If you insist, EMS also includes a Python script to copy a table from the local database to a `.csv` file.

To turn on saving your data to the cloud database, we need to do two things. First, we need to save credentials that tell the database to accept data from our task in a standard location and then tell EMS to use them. The class will provide you with these credentials and we will show you where to install them on FarmShare and your laptop. These credentials are focussed upon just Google Big Query operations. Nonetheless, you can hurt yourself and your classmates by misusing these permissions. Be nice.

We then have two kinds of servers to use -- a single large server and a cluster of smaller servers. On FarmShare, both are invoked via SLURM in a way that is almost identical to your earlier homework. Once the cluster server is running, it then asks SLURM to give it more processors. If they are available, SLURM complies. The cluster server can actually be smaller than the nodes it requests to calculate its answers. All it does is dole out parameters and save DataFrames locally and to the cloud.

The computer activity is rounded out by loading your data into a notebook and then finishing the Tall & Skinny SVD. 

#### Getting Database Access Credentials onto your laptop and Farmshare account

1. Open a terminal window on your laptop. In the shell, run this command:  
    `echo -n -e "\033]0;LAPTOP\007"`

2. Login to FarmShare. [or Sherlock, if you have an account there]  
    `echo -n -e "\033]0;FARMSHARE\007"`

3. Download the security credentials from the Canvas system. (On Mac, the file will end up in your `~/Downloads/` directory.)

4. On your laptop at your login directory:  
	`mkdir .config/gcloud`  
	`cp ~/Downloads/stanford-stats-285-donoho-0dc233389eb9.json ~/.config/gcloud/`

5. On FarmShare at your login directory:  
	`mkdir .config/gcloud`  
	`scp  ~/Downloads/stanford-stats-285-donoho-0dc233389eb9.json su_id@rice.stanford.edu:~/.config/gcloud/`

#### Running code on a server

1. Clone the HW repository. (Note: It's name has changed.):  
	`git clone https://github.com/adonoho/Stats285_F23`

2. Change directory to  
	`cd Stats285_F23/`

3. Examine the contents; does it look modestly familiar?

4. Check if the `conda` environment `stats285` is still around?  
```
	ml anaconda3/2023.07
	conda env list
```

5. If so, delete it:  
	`conda env remove --name stats285`

6. Create a new environment:  
	`conda env create --name stats285 --file environment.yml`  
	(This can take a few minutes.)

7. Turn it on:  
	`source activate stats285`  
	(Note, FarmShare is different from other Unix/Linux shells.)

8. Execute `map_function.py` on an array of nodes:  
	`sbatch hw5_array.sh`  
	`squeue -u $USER`
```
	(stats285) adonoho@rice03:~/Stats285_F23$ squeue -u $USER
			 JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)

		   2422878_900    normal hw5_arra  adonoho  R       0:14      1 wheat08
```
9. Upon completion, about 2 minutes, look inside `hw5_array.err`.

10. Now we will gather the results together on the login node and send them to GBQ. (GBQ will need a `table_name`, `su_id_hw5` in the example below. **Change the `su_id` to your Stanford ID**.):
```
	python3 gather_csv_to_gbq.py su_id_hw5 *.csv
```
`gather_csv_to_gbq.py` will log its command line arguments and will be followed by GBQ acknowledging the receipt of 1000 rows of data.
```

	1000 out of 1000 rows loaded.
```

11. While it is important to know how your local supercomputer works, it is more important to maintain a common workflow. The `sbatch array` is a very different kind of wrapping code and introduces its own complexity of distributed filesystem mediated communication. The EMS system, exploited in `main.py`, runs the same on your laptop and on a large node on FarmShare. This symmetry builds confidence that you are going to get the same answer only faster. As you will see, EMS also launches a cluster on FarmShare with very modest changes and no complex `sbatch` scripting. 
    ####
    **Edit your Stanford ID into the code 'hw5_larg.sh' in the places where `su_ID` appears**. 
    ####
    After, run the following command:  
`sbatch hw5_large.sh`  
`squeue -u $USER`  
    ####
    A line similar to the following should be displayed:
    ```
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
           2422892    normal hw5_larg  adonoho  R       1:28      1 wheat12
    ```

12. In `main.py`, comment out lines 110-111, `do_local_experiment()` and uncomment lines 112-113, `do_cluster_experiment()`. Run the following command:  
`sbatch hw5_cluster.sh`  
`squeue -u $USER`  
Lines similar to the following should be displayed:
```
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)

```

It starts by sharing the `sbatch` script it used to create the workers. Then, every ten calculations it posts some performance metrics, Seconds/Instance is of particular interest. It allows you to project how long each invocation of your experiment will likely take. In this case, it took about 77 seconds to calculate 1000 SVDs. Here is the end of the file:

#### Performing Analysis with Google Colab.

1. Open the `HW5_analysis.ipynb` notebook.
2. Click the 'Open in Colab' button.
3. Run the code in the notebook. Remember to **replace `su_id` with your actual Stanford SUID**.
    * This code will read the data from the cloud database and perform the Tall & Skinny SVD to form
      an approximation of `v_true` (defined in the `generate_data` function of `map_function.py`) 
      using `vt` which is the top right singular vector of the data matrix formed by collecting
      1000 different noisy measurements of the underlying $1000 \times 1000$ matrix.
4. Compare the accuracy of using this `vt` to that obtained 
   from using only one approximation formed using one $1000 x 1000$ matrix.
