[Homework 2. A Brush with Pain and Suffering]

This may be elementary for some students but may be breaking new ground for others.
It gets us all to the same “bare metal” server experience and the pain and suffering
people had since the 1980’s. Our goal in later weeks is to do things in a more modern
way and to understand how things are improving.

We assume that you are using MacOS laptop with some recent version of MacOS
and FarmShare. Small changes might be needed on linux laptops or on Sherlock.

1) Check you can access in the  in Canvas>Stats285>Files>Homework>hw2.zip
   Download the file onto your computer.

2) In a folder of your choice, unzip the file. You should see a folder called hw2.

3) Get the full unix path of the folder hw2. You will need to copy paste this exact string in multiple places below. 
Below, we refer to this location as <PATH>.
   (Ex. It should look something like "/Users/username/Downloads/hw2".)
   (One way to find this is to open a terminal window and drag the folder from a Finder window into the terminal window, then look at the zsh command line.)
   (You can open a terminal window by pressing command+space and typing "terminal" into the search bar. Then press enter.)

3) Familiarize yourself with the contents of the folder. You should see the following files:
     hw2.sh
     hw2script.py
   Explain what you think hw2script.py does.

4) Run hw2script.py on your laptop. Check that it runs for you.
   [a] Supply the transcript of your run.
   [b] From the output, how long does it take to run?

   (You may need to install python, numpy, & pandas. There are many online tutorials on how to do this.)
   (In our experience, ChatGPT gave the clearest/easiest installation instructions.)
   (You may need to review how to run python jobs in MacOS)

5) Modify the program to use nrow=10000 and ncol=1000. Read the wall time from the output. Now how long does the code take to run?

6) Revert the code to nrows=1000 and ncols=1000. Run the program on Stanford's Farmshare server.
   (See instructions below.)

* Open two Terminal windows. (On a Mac, you can create a new terminal window by pressing command+space and typing
  "terminal" into the search bar. Then press enter.)

* In the first window, run the line below:
    echo -n -e "\033]0;MAC LAPTOP\007"
  (This will rename the window to "MAC LAPTOP" for easy reference later.)

* In the second window, run the line below:
    echo -n -e "\033]0;FARMSHARE\007"
  (This will rename the window to "FARMSHARE" for easy-reference later.)

* In the below instructions, we will use [In "MAC LAPTOP"] to refer to commands to be run in the first window
  and [In "FARMSHARE"] to refer to commands to be run the second window.

* [In "FARMSHARE"] Log into Stanford's Farmshare server by entering the below (replace <suid> with your Stanford UserID):
    ssh <suid>@rice.stanford.edu
  (For more details and troubleshooting, see https://srcc.stanford.edu/farmshare/connecting)

* [In "FARMSHARE"] Load the anaconda module by entering the line below:
    module load anaconda3/5.0.1

* [In "FARMSHARE"] Create a folder for stats285 by entering the line below:
    mkdir ~/stats285

* [In "MAC LAPTOP"] Copy the "hw2" into stanford farmshare by entering the line below:
    scp -r <path> <suid>@rice.stanford.edu:~/stats285

* [In "FARMSHARE"] Navigate into the hw2 folder by entering the line below:
    cd ~/stats285/hw2

* [In "FARMSHARE"] Send the hw2.sh script into the scheduler by entering the line below:
    sbatch hw2.sh

* [In "FARMSHARE"] Check the status of your job by entering the line below:
    squeue -u <suid>

* [In "FARMSHARE"] When the code finishes running, it should generate a file called "hw2data.csv" into
  into the hw2 folder. It should also generate output files 'hw2.out' and 'hw2.err' into the hw2 folder.
  Copy them back to your laptop using the following line:
    scp -r <suid>@rice.stanford.edu:~/stats285/hw2 <path>

7) Based on the output, what is the timing comparison between the laptop and the compute node?
   (The output can be found in the hw2.out file. You can view it using the "cat hw2.out" command after navigating to
   it in the terminal.)
